## Slide 2: The Problem

### Headline
**Small Businesses Are Drowning in Manual Work**

### Content
```
🚨 The Reality for Most SMBs:

💬 Customer inquiries overwhelm support teams
   → Lost leads, delayed responses, frustrated customers

⏰ Manual workflows waste 20+ hours per week
   → Copy-pasting between tools, repetitive data entry

📊 Data lives in disconnected silos
   → Can't make informed decisions, missed opportunities

🔧 Too many tools, nothing works together
   → Rising costs, complexity, team burnout
```

### Bottom Line
```
Result: Lost revenue, exhausted teams, slower growth
```

### Speaker Notes
- Make it relatable: "Sound familiar?"
- Specific example: "Imagine a customer emails at 9pm asking about pricing..."
- Transition: "What if there was a better way?"

### Design Notes
- Icons next to each bullet (use emojis or simple icons)
- Red accent color for "Problem" theme
- Keep background light to show urgency
