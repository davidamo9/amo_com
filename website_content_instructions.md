## About Section Content
"I'm a robotics engineer passionate about making robotic automation accessible to everyone. At MOZARK, I develop intuitive automation tools that enable non-programmers to create complex scripts easily, reducing long-term maintenance costs and improving accessibility across diverse applications.

My work spans the full stack of robotics - from hardware design and fabrication to computer vision systems and software frameworks. I recently developed an AI-agentic automated test creation system that makes scripting as intuitive as chatting with an AI.

With a Master's in Robotics from NUS and a background in Electrical Engineering, I combine theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience in deploying robotic solutions across Singapore, Thailand, Manila, and India."

1. Coordinates-based G-code scripts (one script per device per test)
2. Scaling & transformation with RobotSDK (script reusability)
3. Vision-based scripts using text and image locators
4. Robot Framework integration (loops, branches, conditionals)
5. Appium + Vision integration with flexible matching
6. Optics Framework - No-code keyword-based scripting
7. AI-Agentic script creation
